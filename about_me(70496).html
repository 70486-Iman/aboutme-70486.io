<h2>About me</h2>
<p class="p1">Greetings, everyone. My name is Mohd Iman Iskandar but you can just call me Iman. I'm currently 22 years old but will be turning 23
by the end of this year. I have a Filipino father and a Malaysian mother thus making me a mix of both countries, however
I can only speak in the Malay and English languages; no fluency in Tagalog unfortunately. I'm currently studying in UNIMAS as a Software Engineering student. My past academic experience were studying
in UiTM Dengkil for Foundation in Engineering.</p>

<h2>Fun facts about me</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Half Malaysian Half Filipino</li>
  <li>Enjoy playing FPS and JRPGs</li>
  <li>3 Siblings with me as the eldest</li>
  <li>Used to do martial arts</li>
  <li>Relatively quiet most of the time but okay with conversations</li>
</ul>

<h2>My hobbies</h2>
<p class="p1">Usually in my free time, I would most likely be on my PC playing games such as Apex Legends and the Persona series. Other than gaming, I do enjoy doing simple video editing on Da Vinci Resolve
as I do have some interest in doing video editing as a freelancing job in the future. My other hobbies include home cooking as I try to help out my mother in the kitchen most of the time and
I find trying out and learning new recipes fun. Unfortunately, with how hectic with my schedule is this semester, I have to hold on from some of my hobbies for the time being to focus on
studying.</p>
